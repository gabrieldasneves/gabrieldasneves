### Hey! I'm Gabriel 👋

## Brazilian engineer mixing clean code, good UX, and a bit of skate culture.

🌱 I build with TypeScript, React/Next.js, React Native, Node.js & AI tools.

🦴 Fascinated by paleontology — from dinosaurs to evolutionary history.

👯 Always open to collaborating on meaningful, creative projects.

💬 Ask me about dev, UX, science, or prehistoric creatures.

⚡ Fun fact: If I’m not coding, I'm surfing, skating, or reading about ancient life.
